# 🌦️ Weather Now

A simple **React + Vite weather app** built with [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API.  
It shows **current weather conditions** for any searched city (or your current location), with **dynamic animated backgrounds** for sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy, foggy, and night states.

## ✨ Features

- 🔎 Search weather by city name
- 📍 Get weather using **your current location** (via browser geolocation)
- 🌗 Automatic **light/dark theme** switching
- 🌈 **Animated backgrounds** injected via CSS (no Tailwind config changes needed)
- 🌡️ Toggle between **Celsius (°C)** and **Fahrenheit (°F)**
- ❌ **No API key required** (Open-Meteo is free)

The code I got from the gpt is different from the code I used in the final code. Will not say its completely different, because I just installed tailwing the right way instead of using separate files for postcss and tailwind.
